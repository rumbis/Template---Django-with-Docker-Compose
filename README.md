Django Template with Docker Compose
This repository provides a template for developing Django applications using Docker Compose. It aims to simplify the setup process and provide a starting point for building web applications with Django.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

Docker: https://www.docker.com/get-started
Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
Python 3.x: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Getting Started
To use this template, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone rumbis/Template---Django-with-Docker-Compose

pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the Docker containers:
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
Apply database migrations:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
Create a superuser (admin) account:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
Open your browser and access the application at http://localhost:8000/.
Project Structure
The project structure follows the standard Django layout, with additional files for Docker Compose configuration. Here's a brief overview of the main files and directories:

app: Contains the Django project files.
config: Contains configuration files for Docker Compose and environment variables.
docker: Contains Dockerfiles for building the application containers.
postgres: Contains the PostgreSQL database data files.
static: Reserved directory for static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.).
templates: Contains HTML templates for the application.
Configuration
The Django project uses environment variables for configuration. You can customize the settings by modifying the .env file in the config directory. By default, the following variables are available:

DEBUG: Set to True for development, and False for production.
SECRET_KEY: Django secret key for cryptographic signing.
DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL database URL (e.g., postgres://user:password@db:5432/dbname).
ALLOWED_HOSTS: Comma-separated list of allowed hostnames.
Development Workflow
To run the development server with hot-reloading, use the following command:

Copy code
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
This command mounts the Django project directory as a volume inside the container, enabling code changes to be reflected immediately.

Deployment
For deployment, it is recommended to customize the Docker Compose configuration files to suit your environment. Consider using orchestration tools like Kubernetes or AWS ECS for scaling and managing the containers in a production environment.
